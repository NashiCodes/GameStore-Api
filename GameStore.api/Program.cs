 ** I could Abstract the GameRespository class in the IGameRespository interface
 ** And register the interface in the services to inject the class in the endpoints

 ** And the usability of this service is so specific
 ** I decided to use GameRespository class directly in the endpoints using static methods
 ** This way I don't need to create a new instance of GameRespository class in each endpoint
